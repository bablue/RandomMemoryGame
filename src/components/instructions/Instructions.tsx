            The player has to match the current image on screen with the Nth last image, where N indicates the Level at which the player currently is.

            For Example,

            At Level 1 the player has to match the current image with the last image,
            At Level 2 the player has to match the current image with the 2nd last image,
            At Level 3 the player has to match the current image with the 3rd last image and so on.

            The player is supposed to click <strong>{GAME_BUTTONS.correct}</strong> button when he thinks the images match or should click the <strong>{GAME_BUTTONS.wrong}</strong> button when he thinks they donâ€™t match.

            At any given level the player has to answer {NO_OF_TRIALS_PER_LEVEL} questions correctly to proceed to the next level.
