            <Typography>
                The player has to match the current image on screen with the Nth last image, where N indicates the Level at which the player currently is.
            </Typography>
            <Typography subHeading>
                For Example,
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
                At <strong>Level 1</strong> the player has to match the current image with the last image,
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
                At <strong>Level 2</strong> the player has to match the current image with the 2nd last image,
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
                At <strong>Level 3</strong> the player has to match the current image with the 3rd last image and so on.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
                The player is supposed to click <strong>{GAME_BUTTONS.correct}</strong> button when he thinks the images match or should click the <strong>{GAME_BUTTONS.wrong}</strong> button when he thinks they donâ€™t match.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
                At any given level the player has to answer {NO_OF_TRIALS_PER_LEVEL} questions correctly to proceed to the next level.
            </Typography>
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <Button onClick={handleProceed}>{PROCEED_TO_GAME_BUTTON_TEXT}</Button>
